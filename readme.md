* I created my clone of this project form the clever programmer: 
https://github.com/CleverProgrammer/CP-Twilio-Python-Text-App
with a couple of edits.. (changing "TwilioRestClient" to "Client").
* Edit credintials.py by adding your credintials.. to send to a different number, 
you will need to load your twilio account, and change the # in my number field.
* To run this script, nav to the project folder directory in the command prompt, and type:
python -u textme.py << I use Python 3.4
